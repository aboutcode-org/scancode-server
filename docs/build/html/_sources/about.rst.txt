Open Source for Open Source: software license, origin and packages discovery

AboutCode is a project to uncover data ... about software code:

 - where does it come from?
 - what is its license? copyright?
 - is it secure, maintained, well coded?

All these are questions that are important to find answers to when there are million of free and open source software components available on the web.

Where software comes from and what is its license should be a problem of the past such that everyone can safely consume more free and open source software.

Our tools are used to help detect and report the origin and license of source code, packages and binaries as well as discover software and package dependencies, and track security vulnerabilities, bugs and other important software component attributes.
