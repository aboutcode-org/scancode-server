  On Debian distros use: `sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5-dev`

- Install extra utilities if needed: `sudo apt-get install wget build-essential redis-server`


2. Configure a local test database

- Create a local test `scancode` database user. Use `scancode` as password when prompted
  (otherwise use any password and update your settings locally).
  `sudo -u postgres createuser --no-createrole --no-superuser --login --inherit --createdb --pwprompt scancode`

  `createdb --encoding=utf-8 --owner=scancode  --user=scancode --password --host=localhost --port=5432 scancode`

- Create a local virtual environment with `virtualenv .` and activate this with `source bin/activate`
- Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create the db schema `python manage.py migrate`
- Create a local admin user with `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Run a local test server with `python manage.py runserver`
- Run `redis-server`
- Run a local celery worker in a separate shell with `celery -A scanapp worker -l info`
